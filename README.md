# Testing Practice 2

Unit testing practice with Jest (The Odin Project).
A collection of small JavaScript utility functions implemented with a focus on **test-driven development** (TDD) using **Jest**.
Each function has a dedicated test suite to ensure correctness and robustness.

## Functions

- **reverseString** → Reverses the characters in a string.
- **capitalize** → Capitalizes the first character of a string.
- **calculator** → Provides basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- **caesarCipher** → Encodes/decodes text using a Caesar shift.
- **analyzeArray** → Returns basic statistics (`average`, `min`, `max`, `length`) for a numeric array.

## Requirements

- Node.js v20+ (or see `.nvmrc` if present)
- npm (comes with Node)
